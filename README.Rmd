An R interface to the [MEME Suite](http://meme-suite.org/) family of tools,
which provides several utilities for performing motif analysis on DNA, RNA, and
protein sequences. memes works by detecting a local install of the MEME suite,
running the commands, then importing the results directly into R.

## Installation

### Bioconductor

memes is currently available on the Bioconductor `devel` branch:

```{r, eval=F}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# The following initializes usage of Bioc devel
BiocManager::install(version='devel')

BiocManager::install("memes")
```

### Development Version (Github)
You can install the development version of memes from [GitHub](https://github.com/snystrom/memes) with:

```{r, eval=F}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly=TRUE))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("snystrom/memes")
```

### Docker Container
```{shell}
# Get development version from dockerhub
docker pull snystrom/memes_docker:devel
# the -v flag is used to mount an analysis directory, 
# it can be excluded for demo purposes
docker run -e PASSWORD=<password> -p 8787:8787 -v <path>/<to>/<project>:/mnt/<project> snystrom/memes_docker:devel
```


## Detecting the MEME Suite

memes relies on a local install of the [MEME Suite](http://meme-suite.org/).
For installation instructions for the MEME suite, see the [MEME Suite
Installation Guide](http://meme-suite.org/doc/install.html?man_type=web).

memes needs to know the location of the `meme/bin/` directory on your local machine.
You can tell memes the location of your MEME suite install in 4 ways. memes
will always prefer the more specific definition if it is a valid path. Here they
are ranked from most- to least-specific:

1. Manually passing the install path to the `meme_path` argument of all memes functions
2. Setting the path using `options(meme_bin = "/path/to/meme/bin/")` inside your R script
3. Setting `MEME_BIN=/path/to/meme/bin/` in your `.Renviron` file
4. memes will try the default MEME install location `~/meme/bin/`

If memes fails to detect your install at the specified location, it will fall
back to the next option.

To verify memes can detect your MEME install, use `check_meme_install()` which
uses the search herirarchy above to find a valid MEME install. It will report
whether any tools are missing, and print the path to MEME that it sees. This can
be useful for troubleshooting issues with your install.
```{r check_install_works}
library(memes)

# Verify that memes detects your meme install
# (returns all green checks if so)
check_meme_install()
```

```{r check_install_fails}
# You can manually input a path to meme_path
# If no meme/bin is detected, will return a red X
check_meme_install(meme_path = 'bad/path')
```

## The Core Tools

| Function Name | Use              | Sequence Input | Motif Input | Output |
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| `runDreme()`  | Motif Discovery (short motifs)  | Yes | No      | data.frame w/ `motifs` column                          |
| `runAme()`    | Motif Enrichment                | Yes | Yes     | data.frame (optional: `sequences` column)              |
| `runFimo()`   | Motif Scanning                  | Yes | Yes     | GRanges of motif positions                             |
| `runTomTom()` | Motif Comparison                | No  | Yes     | data.frame w/ `best_match_motif` and `tomtom` columns* |
| `runMeme()`   | Motif Discovery (long motifs)   | Yes | No      | data.frame w/ `motifs` column                          |

\* **Note:** if `runTomTom()` is run using the results of `runDreme()`, the results
will be joined with the `runDreme()` results as extra columns. This allows easy
comparison of *de-novo* discovered motifs with their matches.

**Sequence Inputs** can be any of:

1. Path to a .fasta formatted file
2. `Biostrings::XStringSet` (can be generated from GRanges using `get_sequence()` helper function)
3. A named list of `Biostrings::XStringSet` objects (generated by `get_sequence()`)

**Motif Inputs** can be any of:

1. A path to a .meme formatted file of motifs to scan against
2. A `universalmotif` object, or list of `universalmotif` objects
3. A `runDreme()` results object (this allows the results of `runDreme()` to pass directly to `runTomTom()`)
4. A combination of all of the above passed as a `list()` (e.g. `list("path/to/database.meme", "dreme_results" = dreme_res)`)

**Output Types**:

`runDreme()`, and `runTomTom()` return `universalmotif_df` objects which are
data.frames with special columns. The `motif` column contains a `universalmotif`
object, with 1 entry per row. The remaining columns describe the properties of
each returned motif. The following column names are special in that their values
are used when running `update_motifs` to alter the properties of the motifs
stored in the `motif` column. Be careful about changing these values as these
changes will propagate to the `motif` column when calling `update_motifs()` or
`to_list()`.

 - name
 - altname
 - family
 - organism
 - strand
 - nsites
 - bkgsites
 - pval
 - qval
 - eval

memes is built around the [universalmotif package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/universalmotif.html)
which provides a framework for manipulating motifs in R. `universalmotif_df`
objects can interconvert between data.frame and `universalmotif` list format
using the `to_df()` and `to_list()` functions, respectively. This allows use of
`memes` results with all other Bioconductor motif packages, as `universalmotif`
objects can convert to any other motif type using `convert_motifs()`.

`runTomTom()` returns a special column: `tomtom` which is a `data.frame` of all
match data for each input motif. This can be expanded out using
`tidyr::unnest(tomtom_results, "tomtom")`, and renested with `nest_tomtom()`.
The `best_match_` prefixed columns returned by `runTomTom()` indicate values for
the motif which was the best match to the input motif.

## Quick Examples
### Motif Discovery with DREME

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(magrittr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GenomicRanges))

# Example transcription factor peaks as GRanges
data("example_peaks", package = "memes")

# Genome object
dm.genome <- BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm6::BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm6
```
The `get_sequence` function takes a `GRanges` or `GRangesList` as input and
returns the sequences as a `BioStrings::XStringSet`, or list of `XStringSet`
objects, respectively. `get_sequence` will name each fasta entry by the genomic
coordinates each sequence is from.
```{r}
# Generate sequences from 200bp about the center of my peaks of interest
sequences <- example_peaks %>% 
  resize(200, "center") %>% 
  get_sequence(dm.genome)
```

`runDreme()` accepts XStringSet or a path to a fasta file as input. You can use
other sequences or shuffled input sequences as the control dataset.
```{r}
# runDreme accepts all arguments that the commandline version of dreme accepts
# here I set e = 50 to detect motifs in the limited example peak list
# In a real analysis, e should typically be < 1
dreme_results <- runDreme(sequences, control = "shuffle", e = 50)
```
memes is built around the
[universalmotif](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/universalmotif.html)
package. The results are returned in `universalmotif_df` format, which is an R data.frame that can seamlessly interconvert between data.frame and `universalmotif` format using `to_list()` to convert to `universalmotif` list format, and `to_df()` to convert back to data.frame format. Using `to_list()` allows using `memes` results with all `universalmotif` functions like so:

```{r}
library(universalmotif)

dreme_results %>% 
  to_list() %>% 
  view_motifs()
```

### Matching motifs using TOMTOM
Discovered motifs can be matched to known TF motifs using `runTomTom()`, which can accept as input a path to a .meme formatted file, a `universalmotif` list, or the results of `runDreme()`.

TomTom uses a database of known motifs which can be passed to the `database` parameter as a path to a .meme format file, or a `universalmotif` object.

Optionally, you can set the environment variable `MEME_DB` in `.Renviron` to a file on disk, or
the `meme_db` value in `options` to a valid .meme format file and memes will
use that file as the database. memes will always prefer user input to the
function call over a global variable setting.

```{r}
options(meme_db = system.file("extdata/flyFactorSurvey_cleaned.meme", package = "memes"))
m <- create_motif("CMATTACN", altname = "testMotif")
tomtom_results <- runTomTom(m)
```
```{r}
tomtom_results
```

### Using runDreme results as TOMTOM input
`runTomTom()` will add its results as columns to a `runDreme()` results data.frame.
```{r}
full_results <- dreme_results %>% 
  runTomTom()
```


### Motif Enrichment using AME

AME is used to test for enrichment of known motifs in target sequences. `runAme()`
will use the `MEME_DB` entry in `.Renviron` or `options(meme_db =
"path/to/database.meme")` as the motif database. Alternately, it will accept all
valid inputs similar to `runTomTom()`.
```{r}
# here I set the evalue_report_threshold = 30 to detect motifs in the limited example sequences
# In a real analysis, evalue_report_threshold should be carefully selected
ame_results <- runAme(sequences, control = "shuffle", evalue_report_threshold = 30)
ame_results
```


## Visualizing Results

`view_tomtom_hits` allows comparing the input motifs to the top hits from
TomTom. Manual inspection of these matches is important, as sometimes the top
match is not always the correct assignment. Altering `top_n` allows you to show
additional matches in descending order of their rank.

```{r}
full_results %>% 
  view_tomtom_hits(top_n = 1)
```

It can be useful to view the results from `runAme()` as a heatmap. 
`plot_ame_heatmap()` can create complex visualizations for analysis of enrichment
between different region types (see vignettes for details). Here is a simple
example heatmap.
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ame_results %>% 
  plot_ame_heatmap()
```
# Scanning for motif occurances using FIMO

The FIMO tool is used to identify matches to known motifs. `runFimo` will return
these hits as a `GRanges` object containing the genomic coordinates of the motif
match.
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=3}
# Query MotifDb for a motif
e93_motif <- MotifDb::query(MotifDb::MotifDb, "Eip93F") %>% 
  universalmotif::convert_motifs()

# Scan for the E93 motif within given sequences
fimo_results <- runFimo(sequences, e93_motif, thresh = 1e-3)

# Visualize the sequences matching the E93 motif
plot_sequence_heatmap(fimo_results$matched_sequence)  
```

## Importing Data from previous runs

memes also supports importing results generated using the MEME suite outside of
R (for example, running jobs on [meme-suite.org](meme-suite.org), or running on
the commandline). This enables use of preexisting MEME suite results with
downstream memes functions.

| MEME Tool | Function Name       | File Type        |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| Dreme     | `importDremeXML()`  | dreme.xml        |
| TomTom    | `importTomTomXML()` | tomtom.xml       |
| AME       | `importAme()`       | ame.tsv*         |
| FIMO      | `importFimo()`      | fimo.tsv         | 
| Meme      | `importMeme()`      | meme.txt         | 

\* `importAME()` can also use the "sequences.tsv" output when AME used `method = "fisher"`, this is optional.


# FAQs
### How do I use memes/MEME on Windows?
The MEME Suite does not currently support Windows, although it can be
installed under [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or the [Windows Linux Subsytem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL).
Please note that if MEME is installed on Cygwin or WSL, you must also run R
inside Cygwin or WSL to use memes.

An alternative solution is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
to run a virtual environment with the MEME Suite installed. We provide a [memes docker container](https://github.com/snystrom/memes_docker)  
that ships with the MEME Suite, R studio, and all `memes` dependencies
pre-installed.
