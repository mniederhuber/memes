## Inputs
FIMO searches input sequences for occurrances of a motif. `runFimo()` has two
required inputs: fasta-format sequences, with optional genomic coordinate
headers, and a set of motifs to detect within the input sequences.

### Sequence Inputs:
Sequence input to `runFimo()` can be as a path to a .fasta formatted file, or as
a `Biostrings::XStringSet` object. Unlike other memes functions, `runFimo()`
**does not** accept a `Biostrings::BStringSetList` as input. This is to simplify
ranged join operations (see [joins](#joins)) on output data.

By default, `runFimo()` will parse genomic coordinates from sequence entries
from the fasta headers. These are generated automatically if using
`get_sequences()` to generate sequences for input from a `GRanges` object.

```{r}
data("example_chip_summits", package = "memes")

dm.genome <- BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3::BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3

# Take 100bp windows around ChIP-seq summits
summit_flank <- example_chip_summits %>% 
  plyranges::anchor_center() %>% 
  plyranges::mutate(width = 100) 

# Get sequences in peaks as Biostring::BStringSet
sequences <- summit_flank %>% 
  get_sequence(dm.genome)

# get_sequence includes genomic coordinate as the fasta header name
names(sequences)[1:2]
```


### Motif Inputs:
Motif input to `runFimo()` can be as a path to a .meme formatted file, a
list of `universalmotif` objects, or a singular `universalmotif` object.
`runFimo()` will not use any of the default search path behavior for a motif
database as in `runAme()` or `runTomTom()`.

```{r}
e93_motif <- MotifDb::MotifDb %>% 
  # Query the database for the E93 motif using it's gene name
  MotifDb::query("Eip93F") %>% 
  # Convert from motifdb format to universalmotif format
  universalmotif::convert_motifs() %>% 
  # The result is a list, to simplify the object, return it as a single universalmotif
  .[[1]]

# Rename the motif from it's flybase gene number to a more user-friendly name
e93_motif["name"] <- "E93_FlyFactor"
```

## Note about default settings 
`runFimo()` is configured to use different default behavior relative to the
commandline and MEME-Suite Server versions. By default, `runFimo()` runs using
`text` mode, which greatly increases speed and allows returning all detected
matches to the input motifs. By default `runFimo()` will add the sequence of the
matched region to the output data; however, this operation can be very slow for
large sets of regions and can drastically increase the size of the output data.
To speed up the operation and decrease data size, set `skip_matched_sequence =
TRUE`. Sequence information can be added back later using `add_sequence()`. 

```{r}
fimo_results <- runFimo(sequences, e93_motif)
```


## Data integration with join operations {#joins}
The `plyranges` package provides an extended framework for performing
range-based operations in R. While several of its utilities are useful for
range-based analyses, the `join_` functions are particularly useful for
integrating FIMO results with input peak information. A few common examples are
briefly highlighted below:

`plyranges::join_overlap_left()` can be used to add peak-level metadata to motif position information:
```{r}
fimo_results_with_peak_info <- fimo_results %>% 
  plyranges::join_overlap_left(summit_flank)

fimo_results_with_peak_info[1:5]
```

`plyranges::intersect_()` can be used to simultaneously subset input peaks to
the ranges overlapping motif hits while appending motif-level metadata to each
overlap.
```{r}
input_intersect_hits <- summit_flank %>% 
  plyranges::join_overlap_intersect(fimo_results)

input_intersect_hits[1:5]
```

## Identifying matched sequence {#matched-sequence}

When setting `skip_match_sequence = TRUE`, FIMO does not automatically return
the matched sequence within each hit. These sequences can be easily recovered in
R using `add_sequence()` on the FIMO results `GRanges` object.
```{r}
fimo_results_with_seq <- fimo_results %>% 
  plyranges::join_overlap_left(summit_flank) %>% 
  add_sequence(dm.genome)
```

Returning the sequence of the matched regions can be used to re-derive PWMs from different match categories as follows (here done for different binding categories):
```{r}
motifs_by_binding <- fimo_results_with_seq %>% 
  # Split on parameter of interest
  split(mcols(.)$peak_binding_description) %>% 
  # Convert GRangesList to regular list() to use `purrr`
  as.list() %>% 
  # imap passes the list entry as .x and the name of that object to .y
  purrr::imap(~{
    # Pass the sequence column to create_motif to generate a PCM
    create_motif(.x$sequence, 
                 # Append the binding description to the motif name
                 name = paste0("E93_", .y))
    })
```

Motifs from each category can be visualized with `universalmotif::view_motifs()`
```{r}
motifs_by_binding %>% 
  view_motifs()
```

To allow better comparison to the reference motif, we can append it to the list as follows:
```{r}
motifs_by_binding <- c(
  # Add the E93 FlyFactor motif to the list as a reference
  list("E93_FlyFactor" = e93_motif),
  motifs_by_binding
)
```

Visualizing the motifs as ICMs reveals subtle differences in E93 motif sequence
between each category.
```{r}
motifs_by_binding %>% 
  view_motifs()
```

Visualizing the results as a position-probability matrix (PPM) does a better job
of demonstrating that the primary differences between each category are coming
from positions 1-4 in the matched sequences.
```{r}
motifs_by_binding %>% 
  view_motifs(use.type = "PPM")
```

Finally, the sequence-level information can be used to visualize all sequences
and their contribution to the final PWM using `plot_sequence_heatmap`.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=3}
plot_sequence_heatmap(fimo_results_with_seq$sequence)
```


## Importing Data from previous FIMO Runs

`importFimo()` can be used to import an `fimo.tsv` file from a previous run
on the MEME server or on the commandline. Details for how to save data from the
FIMO webserver are below.

### Saving data from FIMO Web Server

To download TSV data from the FIMO Server, right-click the FIMO TSV output link
and "Save Target As" or "Save Link As" (see example image below), and save as
`<filename>.tsv`. This file can be read using `importFimo()`.
